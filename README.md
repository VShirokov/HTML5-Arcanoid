# HTML5-Arcanoid
HTML5 Canvas + JS

You can play on the demo page: https://vshirokov.github.io/HTML5-Arkanoid/

To start the game, press space.
You can control the platform by using the arrows (left and right).

It is a simple arkanoid using native Javascript and HTML5 canvas. In the future I will add features:
1) Menu Interface
3) Multiple levels
3) Number of lives
4) Different color of blocks
5) Various bonuses falling from blocks
